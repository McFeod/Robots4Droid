	<h2> What to do.</h2>
	<p>
		All you need is to destroy all the robots and go to the next level. The  higher level you have reached the much more robots want to kill you. The more robots you are surrounded the more interesting game is. It means you will gain more scores. May be you will win?
	</p>
	<h2>How to reach it.</h2>
	<p>
		We worked hard to make game interesting and attractive to you. We also added some features such as teleport, safe teleport, booby traps and explosions to the game process. If you use it all carefully and wisely, you will learn fastly how to play and easily will become one of the best players ever.

	<h2>Details.</h2>
	<p>
		We believe we did the game easy to understand, so you can skip this part and start playing right now. But remember that knowing all the rules was never harmful to anyone.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Teleport - the easiest way to travel, by the way. But we need to warn you that once it may move you to the robot's action zone. It means you will die there with no chance to revive screaming "OH GOD WHYYY"<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Safe teleport - moving that costs 1 point of energy. Good thing. Useful thing. It will place you onto the point where no robots can reach you right now. But there are no reasons to think robots won't kill you next turn.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Booby traps - just drop this thing on the cell and make the robot touch it. Then say goodbye to robot by paying 3 points of energy.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Explosions - a very large boom around you that costs some points of energy depending on the number of enemies around you, see the number at the bomb pictogram.
	</p>
	<h2>Anything else?</h2>
	<p>
		When robots collide they crush making a heap. Heaps are rather useful. Push it on robot and robot will be lost in the heap. Another way of playing - staying besides the heap and attracting robots by your body to crush into the dumb .
	</p>
	<h2>Where to go?</h2>
	<p>
		Anywhere you want. Or just stay on the cell. It's your game and your life so we can't rule you.
	</p>
	<p>
		WARNING!!! The game is rather endless. There is a big theory book that tells how to win. If you find it, please, contact us, we will be very regardful to you. But this game is a great opportunity to improve your self-estimate by becoming the better player than your friends.

	<h2>Settings</h2>
	<p>
		Sound/silence - simple and useful preference, isn't it?
	</p>
	<p>
		Safe/unsafe mode - if you like to risk, you must know that the unsafe mode was created especially for you. But sometimes every of us wants to be protected by mystic power, that will help you not to mistake. Thanks to us, you may try this. Playing save mode you can't touch robots as we do in museums and zoos.
	</p>
	<p>
		Young chemist mode was created for relaxing your brain. No more comments. Just try it. It's legal.
	</p>
	<p>
		Changing sizes of a game field - set your own sizes for width and height. We've tried a lot of different combinations of numbers and worked out that it's better to use numbers between 15 and 80.
	</p>
	<p>
		Difficulty - sometimes it's really hard to choose whether you need difficulties in your life or not. If you really need it, try to play with fast robots. Remember that playing with danger gives you more scores. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Additional game modes can make game process rather different. In energy shortage mode you are given energy points only once at the beginning of game. Use it wisely.
	</p>
	<p>
		Energy bonus mode encourages aggressiveness. If you attack robot by a heap, you get extra energy points. Using both of additional modes you are not given any points of energy at the beginning and you need to chase after robots to gain energy.
