What to do.\n\
The aim of the game is simple: destroy all robots and get the next level.
Higher level - more robots. More robots - more interest.\n\
How to achieve that.\n\
Our developers worked out game process and included a lot of features in this game: 
teleport, safe teleport, mines and bombs. Using all that correctly, 
you\'ll quickly learn to play good and reach the top of players rating.\n\
What is what.\n\
If you are incredibly clever, you can skip this part. But we advice you not to do this.\n\
Teleport - is the only opportunity to lose in safe game mode. Using teleport, 
you can relocate to the cell with cruel robot. And die there.\n\
Safe teleport - costs energy, relocates you to the cell, where you guaranteed 
won\'t be killed by robot. But it doesn\'t mean that after next movement robot will not reach you.\n\
Mine -\n\
Bomb - energy-intensive thing, that allows you to stay alive longer, by desroying all robots, 
threatening you during the next movement. Junk near you will be exploded also.\n\
What else?\n\
When robots encounter, junk appears. When robot encounters junk, junk remains.\n\
You can push junks on robots, or hide behind them.\n\
Fast (blue) robots can make two steps during one movement.\n\
When you turn safe movements off, you turn off higher power that prevents your misstep.
In safe mode, you can\'t come close to robots. As we do in the zoo.\n\ 
Field is scalable. \n\
Warning! Game is almost endless. You can\'t win. But you can score more points than your friend
and raise your self-esteem by that.\n\
